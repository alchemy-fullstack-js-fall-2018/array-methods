# Array Methods

This List class re-creates simplified version of standard array functionality.

## Map

Returns an array where each item has been transformed according to the callback function.  Skips (but preserves) 'holes' in the array.

## Filter

Returns an array containing only the elements that meet the criteria in the callback.

## Find Index

Returns the index of the first element that meets the criteria in the callback, or -1 if no such element is found.

## Reduce

Returns a single reduced value based on the callback (with or without initial value)

## Every

Return false when any element does not meet the criteria in callback.  Otherwise (all elements meet the criteria), returns true.

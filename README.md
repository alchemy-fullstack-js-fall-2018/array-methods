# Array Methods and TDD

@RyLuras ryanluras@gmail.com


    This project is about further practice with TDD and exploring the mechanics of ES6 Array Methods.

    map, filter, findIndex, reduce, and every are tested, using only simple methods such as for loops and if statements. Tested with a few edge cases such as needing to account for holes in an array.
